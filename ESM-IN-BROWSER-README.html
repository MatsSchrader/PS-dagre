    This HTML file is an example of how you might use the ESM source directly
    in the browser. It can also be used to do a sanity check on the mjs-lib
    directory, as it will throw errors if it (the browser) cannot resolve
    the modules. You might want to change "../graphlib/mjs-lib/index.js"
    to a path pointing to your copy that you'll serve, or a copy somewhere
    on a CDN if one is available.

    If you use a bundler or nodejs, this doesn't matter because, unlike
    a browser, they understand what "@dagrejs/graphlib" means and you
    don't need to resolve it manually. -- @ayjayt on github, 2024-02-01
